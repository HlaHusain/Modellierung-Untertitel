Auto tool task number one, we have four class
diagram candidates.

0:00:06.810,0:00:12.420
And it says: “Which of these class diagram
candidates are valid class diagrams?”

0:00:12.420,0:00:13.980
We're going to use XModeler.

0:00:13.980,0:00:22.150
So, with XModeler, what should happen is
that if we manage to create one of these,

0:00:22.150,0:00:29.109
if we manage to create it, and it's exactly
the same, then it is a valid class diagram.

0:00:29.109,0:00:35.800
If XModeler interrupts and says there is
a problem, and it rejects it does not allow

0:00:35.800,0:00:41.470
us to create this class diagram and you have
these class diagrams, then it is invalid.

0:00:41.470,0:00:46.930
Let's do number one.

0:00:46.930,0:01:03.230
They have A, B, C, D, let's just
do them first and then we connect.

0:01:03.230,0:01:14.680
A is here, C is here and then B is
down here, D to the left.

0:01:14.680,0:01:16.720
Let's try to connect them.

0:01:16.720,0:01:20.409
So, they are connected now with inheritance.

0:01:20.409,0:01:22.090
No associations involved.

0:01:22.090,0:01:30.290
So, right click this, change parent to C.
So far, no problems.

0:01:30.290,0:01:33.820
Let me fix this.

0:01:33.820,0:01:44.119
Now, let's change parent of C make it B.

0:01:44.119,0:01:45.979
This is fine.

0:01:45.979,0:01:53.509
Let me fix this.

0:01:53.509,0:02:00.590
And now, parent of B should be D.

0:02:00.590,0:02:05.440
This is also fine.

0:02:05.440,0:02:16.890
And finally parent of D should be B. And it
says: “B is already a descendant of D, circular

0:02:16.890,0:02:19.420
inheritance is not allowed.”

0:02:19.420,0:02:25.470
So, this means this class diagram or actually
this class diagram candidate is not a class

0:02:25.470,0:02:26.470
diagram.

0:02:26.470,0:02:28.150
This is invalid.

0:02:28.150,0:02:32.170
Let's do the second one.

0:02:32.170,0:02:35.970
Let me remove this.

0:02:35.970,0:02:46.420
Actually, the second one also has A, B, C,
D. So, let me just add the class again.

0:02:46.420,0:02:50.420
Let me remove this.

0:02:50.420,0:02:52.330
It's not possible to remove this, I don't
think it's possible.

0:02:52.330,0:02:59.890
So, what I'm going to do is actually remove
them, yes.

0:02:59.890,0:03:14.110
And add B, add C. So, we have B here, we have
A in the middle and we have D here, we have

0:03:14.110,0:03:19.480
C here.

0:03:19.480,0:03:37.440
Change parent to B. Change parent to B change
parent to B. So, let me fix this mess.

0:03:37.440,0:03:51.629
And this looks exactly like the class
diagram here.

0:03:51.629,0:03:56.360
This means class diagram number 2 or candidate
number 2 is a valid class diagram.

0:03:56.360,0:04:03.890
Now let's do number 3.

0:04:03.890,0:04:14.280
Change parent to B and fix this.

0:04:14.280,0:04:47.169
Change parent of B to D.
And change parent of D to A.

0:04:47.169,0:04:57.750
And change parent of A to B.
And again B is already a descendant of A,

0:04:57.750,0:05:00.090
circular inheritance is not allowed.

0:05:00.090,0:05:03.900
So, this means number three is also not a
class diagram.

0:05:03.900,0:05:06.080
This is invalid.

0:05:06.080,0:05:10.850
Let's do number four.

0:05:10.850,0:05:59.509
Change parent to C. Change parent to B, change parent
to D. This should fix it.

0:05:59.509,0:06:01.710
And it looks exactly like this one.

0:06:01.710,0:06:05.200
So, this means number four is valid.

0:06:05.200,0:06:06.910
This is a class diagram in fact.
